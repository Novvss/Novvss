byi
- i am easily overwhelmed
- if i am on busy, dniuf and iwc.
- i dont put it in my pt stuff(since people really enjoy to harass dnt ponies.) but i prefer not to be touched ingame. booping and c/h is fine (if c/h is listed on pony name) but dont be a freak in game to me it makes me uncomfy. "it's just pixels" but you're harassing me :eyes:
- dont make weird comments about characters if im in a cos. i am not that character.
- i like comfort from friends when im on busy. i'm not expecting anything, ofc. if we're conversing and i get overwhelmed ill ask to move or stay in whispers so i can distract myself from whatevers going on.

i hide people i dont like. i dont have many hidden but if you pmo and i stop responding youre probably hidden
i dont friend people i dont know well

thats it..! ily ponytown
